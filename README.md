# Winners Online Hospital
While doing a survey on medical services in my country, I realized that some long queues experienced in hospital can be done away with by reducing the number of patients visiting hospitals. Some illnesses that need no laboratory tests can be done online like consultations and mental therapy. Besides, if you wanna see a doctor, you can book online so that you you arrive at the right time when the doctor is not engaged but just waiting for you. So Winners came up with Winners Online Hospital to to help patients access some health care services online.

In this project, I used the following techniques:

* HTML
* CSS
* JQuery
* Bootstrap

The app which is now published can be accessed here: https://ruthwinfred.github.io/NewWinnersOnlineHospital/Index.html
You'll first land on the home page which allows you to navigate to other windows like About us, Services,Contact us,etc. However, some pages like Book appointment, Register, Login and Dashboard needs server authontification which are not yet ready but will be very soon. Enjoy your tour at the Winners Online Hospital.
