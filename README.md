# Winners Online Hospital
While doing a survey on medical services in my country, I realized that some long queues experienced in hospital can be done away with by reducing the number of patients visiting hospitals. Some illnesses that need no laboratory tests can be done online like consultations and mental therapy. Besides, if you wanna see a doctor, you can book online so that you you arrive at the right time when the doctor is not engaged but just waiting for you. So Winners came up with Winners Online Hospital to to help patients access some health care services online.

In this project, I used the following techniques:

* HTML
* CSS
* JQuery
* Bootstrap
